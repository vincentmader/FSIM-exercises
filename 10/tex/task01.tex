In this exercise you are going to write and 
use an Eulerian finite-volume code (based on 
the Godunov method) to solve the 1D equations
of isothermal hydrodynamics:
\begin{align}
    0&=
    \pder{\rho}{t}+
    \pder{\rho u}{x} \\
    0&=
    \pder{(\rho u)}{t}+
    \pder{[\rho u^2+P]}{x} \\
\end{align}
where $\rho$ is the density, $u$ the velocity, 
and $P$ the pressure. \\
\\
The system is written in 
conservative form. The set of conservative 
variables is 
\begin{equation}
    \vec q=
    \begin{bmatrix}
        \rho \\ \rho u        
    \end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}
and the fluxes are 
\begin{equation}
    \vec F_\textnormal{Euler}=
    \begin{bmatrix}
        \rho u \\ \rho u^2+P     
    \end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}
Consider a small linear perturbation on 
the density:
\begin{equation}
    \rho(x,t)=
    \rho_0+\delta\rho(x,t)
\end{equation}
We can Fourier-decompose $\delta\rho(x,t)$
into modes of the type 
\begin{equation}
    \delta\rho(x,t)
    =A\cdot e^{i(kx-\omega t)}
\end{equation}

\paragraph{3. Argue, on the basis of these 
    solutions, that the isothermal sound 
    speed is $c_s=\sqrt{P/\rho}$, so that 
    $P=\rho c_s^2$.

\paragraph{4. Show that the system of 
    isothermal Euler equations has the 
    Eigen-values $\lambda_{1}=u-c_s$,
    $\lambda_{2}=u+c_s$ associated with the 
    Eigen-vectors $\vec K_{1}=[1, u-c_s]^T$ 
    and $\vec K_{2}=[1, u+c_s]^T$
