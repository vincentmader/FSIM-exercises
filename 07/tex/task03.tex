This problem is not obligatory, as it can be quite time-consuming and 
may require a bit of frustration-resistance. The assignment is to 
design and test a 3D Poission equation solver on a cartesian grid of 
$n\times n\times n$ grid points. Take for a start $n=10$. At the 
boundary cells, ribbon cells and corner cells we set $\Phi=0$. At the 
center of the grid we make a $2\times 2\times 2$ block of cells with a 
non-zero density, whereas the rest of the grid has zero density. \\

\paragraph{
    a) Use the Biconjugate Gradient (or Biconjugate Gradient Stabilized) 
    method to solve this equation. Advice: make sure that you normalize 
    the equations such that the diagonal elements of the boundary cells 
    are not vastly larger or smaller (in their absolute values) than 
    those of the inner grid cells.

    b) Make plots of the solution by taking a 1D or 2D cut along the 
    center of the box.
